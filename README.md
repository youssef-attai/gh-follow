## Follow your followers

This is a tool written in Javascript (Node.js) that automates 
unfollowing all users you follow and following all your followers instead,
using GitHub's API.

âš  **Following your followers does not work properly.
The function `followAllFollowers()` follows most followers,
but not all of them.**

If you have any idea why this happens,
I would really appreciate your help.
